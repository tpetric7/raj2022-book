# Spracherwerbsdaten

## Programme


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
```


## Daten lesen

Verwendet werden die Transkriptionsdateien der normalhörenden deutschsprachigen Kinder im Korpus von *Szagun*.    

Zuerst wird das Arbeitsverzeichnis festgelegt.
Dann werden alle (relevanten) Excel-Dateien gelesen und in der Variable "data" (einer Liste) gespeichert, die die Erwerbsdaten von 6 Kindern und deren Müttern enthält. Die Dateien konzentrieren sich auf sechs d-Wörter, die als Demonstrativpronomen und bestimmter Artikel dienen können.

Code (Version 1):   
Wir erhalten 12 Datensätze (6 Kinder und 6 erwachsene Bezugspersonen, meistens die Mutter).


```r
library(fs)

wd <- getwd()
wdd <- paste0(wd,"/data/szagun/")

file_paths <- fs::dir_ls(wdd)
file_paths
```

```r
data <- file_paths %>%
    map(function (path) {
        readxl::read_xlsx(path, skip = 3)
    })
# data
```

Code (Version 2):   
Wir erhalten 12 Datensätze (6 Kinder und 6 erwachsene Bezugspersonen, meistens die Mutter).


```r
# rahel <- read_excel("data/Rahel_Mot.xlsx")

wd <- getwd()
wdd <- paste0(wd,"/data/szagun/")
setwd(wdd)

data.files = list.files(path = wdd, pattern = "\\.xlsx", 
                        full.names = TRUE,
                        recursive = FALSE) # TRUE if subdirectories included
data <- lapply(data.files, readxl::read_excel, skip = 3)
# data

# dataframes: which columns are in common?
# common_cols <- intersect(colnames(f), colnames(g))
```

## Verknüpfung der einzelnen Dateien 

Mit Clan wurden 12 Excel-Dateien zusammengestellt. Die Excel-Dateien werden nun zu einer einzelnen zusammengefasst. Zu diesem Zweck werden mit Hilfe einer Programm-Schleife mehrere Veränderungen vorgenommen:   
- die data-Liste wird in einen Datensatz umgewandelt (as.data.frame, as_tibble),   
- nicht relevante Variablen eliminiert (select),   
- Variablen umbenannt (rename),   
- neue Variablen aus bereits bestehenden geschaffen (separate),   
- fehlende Spalten (z.B. für "das") hinzugefügt (if ... add_column),   
- Variablen konvertiert (as.numeric).


```r
szagun <- NULL
szagun <- data.frame()

for(i in 1:length(data)){
  f <- data[i] %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% as_tibble() %>% clean_names() %>%
    dplyr::select(-c(language, corpus, sex, group, race, ses, role, 
              education, custom_field)) %>%
    rename(utterances = starts_with("x_")) %>% 
    # mutate(des = ifelse("des" %in% names(.), des, NA)) %>% # add missing column "des" (but this doesn't work)
    separate(file, into = c("id", "location"), sep = ",") %>%
    dplyr::select(-location) %>%
    rename(ageof = age) %>%
    separate(id, into = c("id", "age"), sep = "_")
  
  if(!'des' %in% names(f)) {
    # if column "des" is missing, add it to dataframe, fill 0
    f <- f %>% add_column(des = 0)}
  # append file to previous file
  szagun <- rbind(szagun, f)
}

szagun <- szagun %>% 
  mutate(ttr = as.numeric(ttr))

szagun <- szagun %>% 
  rename(age1 = age, age = ageof) %>% 
  mutate(age = age1) %>% 
  mutate(age = paste0(str_sub(age, 1, 1), ";",  
         str_sub(age, 2, 3), ".", str_sub(age, 4, 5)))
```

Die gemeinsamen Spalten in Datensätzen (hier: *f*) kann man übrigens mit der Funktion `intersect()` herausfinden.


```r
common_cols <- intersect(colnames(f), colnames(f))
```


Hier ist nun die gesamte Tabelle (mit 6 Kindern und 6 Erwachsenen) für den von Szagun ausgewählten Beobachtungszeitraum.


```r
library(DT)

  DT::datatable(filter = "top", fillContainer = T,
              extensions = c('Buttons', "ColReorder", "RowReorder",

                             autowidth = TRUE,
                             colReorder = TRUE, 
                             rowReorder = TRUE, order = list(c(0, 'asc')),
                             keys = TRUE,
                             deferRender = TRUE,
                             scrollY = 600, scroller = TRUE,
                             scrollX = TRUE,
                             fixedColumns = 
                               list(leftColumns = 2, rightColumns = 1),
                             dom = 'Bfrtip', # Bfrtip or t
    buttons = c('colvis','copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')
  )) %>%
  formatStyle("id",
  target = 'row',
  backgroundColor = styleEqual(c(0, 1), c('gray30', 'lightblue')))

In der Gesamttabelle haben wir einen Fehler, den wir noch berichtigen müssen. Für die Mütter stehen uns nicht für jeden Monat Zahlen zur Verfügung. Dieser Zuordnungsfehler (MOT-Daten bei CHI zugeordnet) ist in der Graphik mit `plotly` (s.u.) bemerkbar. Außerdem gibt es auch kleinere monatliche Unterschiede bei den Kindern. Die Altersangaben müssen wir demnach vereinfachen (nur Jahr und Monat, eventuell auch bestimmte Monate zusammenfassen).

Das lassen wir im Augenblick noch außer Acht.

Sowohl bei den Kindern (CHI) als auch bei den Müttern (MOT) ergibt sich fast dieselbe Reihenfolge der Häufigkeiten. Der auffälligste Unterschied ist der zwischen den Häufigkeiten von *des* und *dem*. 


```r
d_dem <- szagun %>% 
  pivot_longer(das:die, names_to = "d_wort", values_to = "freq") %>% 
  group_by(code, d_wort) %>% 
  summarise(freqsum = sum(freq)) %>%

d_dem
```

```

##   <chr>  <dbl> <dbl>
## 1 andere 24312 13898
## 2 dem      103   378
```


Mit dem $\chi^2$-Quadrat-Test kann man prüfen, ob die beiden Stichproben statistisch signifikant unterschiedlich sind.


```r
chires <- chisq.test(d_dem[,-1], B = 2000) # B: mit Monte Carlo test

```

Eine Frequenztabelle mit den d-Wörtern von *Soren* und seiner *MOT* (aber ohne $\chi^2$-Quadrat-Test):


```r
szagun %>% 
  filter(id == "Soeren") %>% 
  pivot_longer(das:die, names_to = "d_wort", values_to = "freq") %>% 
  group_by(code, d_wort) %>% 
  summarise(freqsum = sum(freq)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = code, values_from = freqsum)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   d_wort   CHI   MOT
##   <chr>  <dbl> <dbl>
## 1 das     2552  1136
## 2 dem        9    24
## 3 den      432   198
## 4 der     1101   300
## 5 des       24     1
## 6 die     1556   519
```

## 3. Welche Form als erste?

Zur Beantwortung dieser Frage filtern wir zuerst die Spalten *id* und *code*. Dann sortieren wir die jeweilige Tabellen für das ausgewählte Kind nach Alter *age*. Mit der Funktion `pivot_longer()` bilden wir eine lange Tabellenform. 


```r
szagun %>% 
  filter(id == "Rahel",
         code == "CHI") %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  pivot_longer(das:die, names_to = "d_wort", values_to = "freq") %>% 
  filter(freq > 0)
```
