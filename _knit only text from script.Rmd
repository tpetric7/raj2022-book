We can knit this document using knitr::knit("_untertitel.Rmd"), but in this case code chunks will be included in text. To deal with this we need to set knitr options:

```{r}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(list(echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE))
knit("_untertitel.Rmd")

```

This command will create output document foo.md only with text.

    Hi there! So if I now have this "_untertitel.Rmd" saved on my PC, how can I read it in that I only have the text elements in my workspace? –

    @Inkling you need to run those three code lines and then: readLines("_foo_untertitel.md"). Let me know how it goes –
